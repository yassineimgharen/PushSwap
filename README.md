*This project has been created as part of the 1337 school by yaimghar.*

The push_swap project is a sorting algorithm challenge using c and two stacks a and b.
Its goal is to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of stack operations (like push, swap, rotate, and reverse rotate), with the fewest possible moves.
u must write a program that outputs the sequence of operations needed to sort the numbers,

**compilation**
To compile the project, run:
make and make bonus (if u want to check with my checker)

run the progrm with a list of integers
./push_swap 3 2 1
or
./push_swap "3 2 1"
...

for the checker, run:
var="4 67 3 87 23"; ./push_swap $var | ./checker $var
