# - Python Interpreter: This is the program (like python3) that reads your Python code,
#                      compiles it to bytecode, and runs it.
#                      It manages the whole process of executing your .py files.

# - PVM (Python Virtual Machine): This is a part of the interpreter. 
#                             After your code is compiled to bytecode, 
#                             the PVM executes that bytecode. 
#                             It acts as a virtual computer that understands Python’s bytecode instructions.

#The format() method in Python is used to insert values into a string at positions marked by curly braces {}.

# When you run a Python file, Python sets a special variable called name.
# If you run the file directly (like python myfile.py), name is "main".


# Use 4 spaces per indentation level (no tabs).
# Lines should be no longer than 79 characters.
# Use blank lines to separate functions and classes.
# Variable and function names should be lowercase_with_underscores.
# No unused imports or variables.
# Add a space after commas, around operators, and after # in comments.
# No extra spaces inside parentheses or brackets.
# Always use consistent indentation and avoid trailing whitespace.
